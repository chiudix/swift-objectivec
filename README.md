================

Working with Swift and Objective C

This project is an exploration of issues around objective-c properties that take a block or in what I'm testing here is a swift function. It also makes things more complicated by having the properties defined in protocols, and also looking at what difference making the property an optional property of the protocol. Then we try and access these properties and call into objective-c from swift.
